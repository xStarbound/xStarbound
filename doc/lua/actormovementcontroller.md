# Actor `mcontroller`

The `mcontroller` table sometimes contains functions relating to the actor movement controller.

This section of `mcontroller` documentation refers to the `ActorMovementController` Lua bindings. The `ActorMovementController` is the one used by the following kinds of entities:

- monsters
- NPCs
- players

These `mcontroller` bindings are available in the following scripts running on players, NPCs and monsters:

- generic player scripts
- tech scripts
- active item scripts
- companion system scripts
- status effect scripts
- status controller scripts
- quest scripts
- active item scripts

See `movementcontroller.md` for documentation on the `mcontroller` table for base `MovementController`s (the ones used by projectiles and vehicles).

## Controls

The actor movement controller has a set of controls. Controls can be set anywhere and are accumulated and evaluated after all scripts are run. Controls will either override previously set controls, or combine them.

Controls are either cleared before every script update, or can be set to be manually cleared.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlRotation(`float` rotation)

Rotates the controller. Each control adds to the previous one.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlAcceleration(`Vec2F` acceleration)

Controls acceleration. Each control adds to the previous one.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlForce()

Controls force. Each control adds to the previous one.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlApproachVelocity(`Vec2F` targetVelocity, `float` maxControlForce)

Approaches the targetVelocity using the force provided. If the current velocity is higher than the provided targetVelocity, the targetVelocity will still be approached, effectively slowing down the entity.

Each control overrides the previous one.

---

#### `void` mcontroller.controlApproachVelocityAlongAngle(`float` angle, `float` targetVelocity, `float` maxControlForce, `bool` positiveOnly = false)

Approaches the targetVelocity but only along the provided angle, not affecting velocity in the perpendicular axis. If positiveOnly, then it will not slow down the movementController if it is already moving faster than targetVelocity.

Each control overrides the previous one.

---

#### `void` mcontroller.controlApproachXVelocity(`float` targetVelocity, `float` maxControlForce)

Approaches an X velocity. Same as using approachVelocityAlongAngle with angle 0.

Each control overrides the previous one.

---

#### `void` mcontroller.controlApproachYVelocity(`float` targetVelocity, `float` maxControlForce)

Approaches a Y velocity. Same as using approachVelocityAlongAngle with angle (Pi / 2).

Each control overrides the previous one.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlParameters(`ActorMovementParameters` parameters)

Changes movement parameters. Parameters are merged into the base parameters.

Each control is merged into the previous one.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlModifiers(`ActorMovementModifiers` modifiers)

Changes movement modifiers. Modifiers are merged into the base modifiers.

Each control is merged into the previous one.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlMove(`float` direction, `bool` run)

Controls movement in a direction.

Each control replaces the previous one.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlFace(`float` direction)

Controls the facing direction.

Each control replaces the previous one.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlDown()

Controls dropping through platforms.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlCrouch()

Controls crouching.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlJump()

Controls starting a jump. Only has an effect if canJump is true.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlHoldJump()

Keeps holding jump. Will not trigger a new jump, and can be held in the air.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.controlFly(`Vec2F` direction)

Controls flying in the specified direction (or {0, 0} to stop) with the configured flightSpeed parameter.

Each control overrides the previous one.

---

##### `bool` mcontroller.autoClearControls()

Returns whether the controller is currently set to auto clear controls before each script update.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.setAutoClearControls(`bool` enabled)

Set whether to automatically clear controls before each script update.

---

##### `void` mcontroller.clearControls()

Manually clear all controls.
